# Python-Image-recognition
This Python code reads a series of Google Pay screenshots and attempts to extract specific information from them using template matching and OCR. It loads a set of template images, defines regions of interest for each template, and uses the SIFT feature detector and BFMatcher to find the best matching template in each screenshot. If a template match is found, it extracts a region of interest from the screenshot based on the defined coordinates and applies OCR using pytesseract to extract text information from the region. The extracted information is then saved to an Excel file. The code iterates over 100 screenshots and attempts to extract information from each one using the defined templates and regions of interest.
